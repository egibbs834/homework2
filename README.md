### Overview
* Attached you'll find links to my portfolio website (1st iteration).
* It was designed with the goals of using semantic HTML and being responsive for any viewport. 
* I utilized the following tools and concepts when creating the pages:
    * Bootstrap (especially the grid system)
    * Consistent Navbar with working links
* I am looking forward to making continuous improvements to these pages with the goal of having them ready to be view by potential employers by the end of this program.
